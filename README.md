# Rafi's Landing Page - VC SOE

[Here](https://www.figma.com/) is a link to the [inspiration page](https://www.figma.com/) for [my site](https://dartmouth-cs52-19s.github.io/lab1-landingpage-rkhaled98/).

## What worked

Overall, I like how most of the look and feel for the site turned out. Especially the animation in the
greeting, which rotates between describing the site as "A society of [Engineers, People, Friends...]". Flex box
worked very nicely and made me a lot more confident in developing complicated pages. For some reason, the reactive footer
always looked the most intimidating to me to produce, but now I realize it is more tame than I thought, even though
there are still some stylistic bugs with it.

## What didn't work

The fixed position sign up button gave me some issues in terms of logistics of the initial animation downwards, 
because I think the inspiration site may have used some JavaScript to accomplish it. 
I would love to know how and if this can be implemented in pure CSS. Also, unfortunately I didn't have enough time
to develop a nice looking drop down menu for mobile, so I decided to comment out my progress in the latest commit.
